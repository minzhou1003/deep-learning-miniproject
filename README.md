# deep-learning-miniproject

## Introduction and Goals:
1. Use TensorFlow (or any tool you prefer) to recognize between two classes of objects.  These classes could be:
* Cars and Trucks or Cars and SUVs
* Roses and Sunflowers or Vegetables
2. You need to capture the images yourself and tag them.  You can use any Tagging system (e.g, https://hubs.ly/H0dktLv0 Neurala).  
3. You need to design your own Training, Testing and Verification sets.
4. You need to compare between two different systems based on the literature review you did and/or reading material provided
Bonus:  Provide an API with example code for another developer to use your system
